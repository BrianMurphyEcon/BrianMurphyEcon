### 👋 Hi, I’m Brian Murphy!

I'm a PhD student in Economics. My interests lie at the intersection of:

- 🎓 Education Economics  
- 💼 Labor Economics 

When I'm not coding or writing papers, you'll find me watching Philly sports — go Birds, Phillies, Sixers, and Flyers! 🦅⚾🏀🏒

### 👀 What I'm Looking For

I would love to collaborate on empirical research projects in economics, especially in:

- Education and inequality  
- Labor market sorting

If you have an idea or dataset in these areas, let’s chat!
