### 👋 Hi, I’m Brian Murphy (@BrianMurphyEcon)

I'm a PhD student in Economics with a passion for applied microeconomics research. My interests lie at the intersection of:

- 🎓 Education Economics  
- 💼 Labor & Human Capital  
- 🌍 Development Economics  

When I'm not coding or writing papers, you'll probably find me watching Philly sports — go Birds, Phillies, Sixers, and Flyers! 🦅⚾🏀🏒

### 👀 What I'm Looking For

I'm eager to collaborate on empirical research projects in economics, especially in:

- Education and inequality  
- Labor market sorting and job networks  
- Health outcomes in low-income populations  
- Field experiments and policy evaluations

If you have an idea or dataset in these areas, let’s talk!
